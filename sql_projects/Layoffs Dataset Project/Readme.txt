Open MySQL Workbench or connect to MySQL via the command line.

Use the Data Cleaning (layoffs) SQL script to create a new schema and import the dataset.

Import Dataset:

The dataset (layoffs.csv) should be placed in the same folder as the SQL scripts.

Follow the steps in the Data Cleaning (layoffs) script to import the CSV into MySQL.

Run the Data Cleaning Script:

Once the data is imported, execute the SQL commands from the Data Cleaning (layoffs) script to clean the data and create a layoffs_copy table.

Run the Data Exploration Script:

After the data cleaning step is complete, you can run the Data Exploration (layoffs) script to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned data.
